    <h1>Baked Chicken Meatballs</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These are the most easy and versatile baked chicken meatballs. 
        You can make them any day, for any occasion. It’s what we call a back-pocket recipe!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Nonstick cooking spray, or 2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chicken (preferably with 5% or more fat)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan, or Romano cheese</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk (any kind)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped, loosely packed</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, grated</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong>Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and spray it lightly with cooking spray or lightly brush 1 teaspoon olive oil on it. </li>
        <li><strong>Make the chicken mixture:</strong>In a large bowl, combine the ground chicken, breadcrumbs, Parmesan, milk, parsley, garlic, egg, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes, if using. Use your clean hands to gently mix until combined. Stop as soon as the ingredients are evenly distributed and be careful not to over-mix, since this will make the meatballs tough.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the meatballs:</strong>
            <p>
                Use your fingers to pinch off enough mixture to make a 1-inch meatball. Use the palm of your hands to gently roll it into a ball, being careful to compress the mixture as little as possible. This will help keep the meatballs light.

            <p>
                Place the meatball on the prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining mixture. Space the meatballs evenly on the baking sheet so that they don’t touch. You should have about 24 meatballs.          
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Spray the tops lightly with cooking spray or brush them lightly with the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil.
            </p>           
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
